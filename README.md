# ⚡ PowerGrid Cyber Crisis — OT/ICS Cyber Range Game

Interactive cyber-security simulation & CTF in a fictional continental power grid.

PowerGrid Cyber Crisis is a browser-based cyber range designed to teach
incident response, privilege escalation, log analysis, phishing detection and OT/SCADA security
through an immersive, story-driven scenario.

You take the role of an operator in a national grid control center while a ransomware campaign spreads across interconnected power plants.
Your tools: a terminal, internal email system, live news feeds, blue-team dashboard, and plant telemetry.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Your job is to:

1. Read alerts from engineering & CERT.
2. Investigate compromised servers through the terminal.
3. Identify escalation vectors.
4. Contain the incident and secure critical plants.
5. Uncover the ransomware actor’s method & clean the system.

This is not a “hacking simulator”.
It is a blue-team / DFIR / OT-incident-response experience with CTF elements.
