# ⚡ OT/ICS Incident Response Simulation

Interactive cyber-security simulation in a fictional continental power grid.

PowerGrid Cyber Crisis is a browser-based cyber range designed to teach
incident response, privilege escalation, log analysis, phishing detection and OT/SCADA security
through an immersive, story-driven scenario.

The participant operates as a grid control center operator in a national grid control center while a ransomware campaign spreads across interconnected power plants.
Your tools: a terminal, internal email system, live news feeds, blue-team dashboard, and plant telemetry.

## 🚀 Features

### 🖥️ Realistic terminal sandbox

* Linux-like file system
* Permissions, owners, `/etc/passwd`, `/proc`
* `sudo`, `su`, user switching
* Misconfigurations and escalation vectors
* Hidden credential leak, log analysis, backup exploit
* Fully scripted commands: `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `sudo`, `tar`, …

### 🏭 Operational Technology / SCADA simulation

* 40+ fictional power plants
* Hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, geothermal, gas, mixed
* Dynamic incidents & state changes
* Autogenerated configs, logs, and critical directories

### 📨 Internal communication

* Email system with phishing attempts
* Incident reports
* Engineering memos
* Alerts from CERT teams

### 🌍 Live News Feed

- Ransomware-triggered international news
- Country-specific headlines
- Media pressure as a gameplay mechanic

## 🎯 Simulation Overview

Participants are expected to:

- Monitor alerts and internal communications
- Investigate anomalies using system tools
- Identify root causes and escalation paths
- Make containment decisions under time pressure
- Manage operational impact across the grid

This is not a “hacking simulator”.
It is a blue-team / DFIR / OT-incident-response simulation with experiential learning elements.
